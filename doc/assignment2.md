## Assignment 2, CS6905 W2023

## Instructions

Complete the tasks described on [Prof B's Task Board](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP6905/projects/2) in establishing a methodology and a software process for your project team. 

* Tasks with the status  _Todo: Assignment 2_ must be completed for assignment 2. These tasks will contribute to the group/team grade.
* The team must assign a _code_ task to each team member which will contribute to the project, but will be used to assign an individual grade.

## Code Tasks

The _code__ task suggestions are posted on the KanBan board. The description of each task is left vague, because many of the tasks will change scope depending on the team's Architecture design and choice of frameworks and/or other technologies. You should note the following about code tasks:

* coding tasks must entail a substantial coding effort. If the team adopts a codebase or web framework (such as expressjs), some of the suggested tasks may become trivial and should be combined into a single coding task.
* the coding task should be substantial but reasonable to complete with in the current development cycle time. Remember that coding must be completed well before the due date, since your software process will include a code review that takes time. 
* be careful adopting a framework or tool if not everyone on the team is familiar with it. The team must commit to helping that individual with the framework or tool.
* It is OK to acknowledge some members are more experienced coders, and establish team roles accordingly. You may want to designate a well-organized and reliable team member as technical lead, for example.
* You can get help with your code as long as your attribute the help received in your code documentation. This help can come from team members, classmates, online, or elsewhere. Your main contribution in the code task is to contribute code that follows the software process and applies good coding practice and software engineering practice. You don't have to be a superior coder to do these things, but you may need help with your coding.

## Process

Your team is to define and establish its own process, but you are expected to include these elements:

* an agile approach using a KanBan board to track progress
* synchronization of release cycles to the assignment due dates 
* SCRUM style weekly (or more frequent) meetings, marking main decisions of the project team and establishing work assignments. The first and last meeting of a cycle should establish work assignments (first meet) and review the work performance (last meet), among other agenda items.
* documentation of activities and decisions for the team reference and verification; and for the marker to evaluate the project submissions.

## README.md

Your readme file should describe the team, project, outline its current status, the repository structure and direct the marker how to find the evaluation components of the submission.

In addition, attribution of sources should be indicated in the README file.

## Evaluation

An evaluation scheme will be posted on the course web page.
